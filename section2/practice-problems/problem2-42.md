### Problem

- Write a function `div16` that returns the value x/16 for integer argument x. 
- Your function should not use division, modulus, multiplication, any conditionals (if or ?:), any comparison operators (e.g., <, >, or ==), or any loops. 
- You may assume that data type int is 32 bits long and uses a twoâ€™s-complement representation, and that right shifts are performed arithmetically.


### Solution

- Logical shifting
- 16 is 2^4
- x>>4 is x/16
