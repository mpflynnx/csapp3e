### Problem

Consider the following two 7-bit floating-point representations based on the IEEE floating-point format. Neither has a sign bitâ€”they can only represent nonnegative numbers.
1. Format A
    - There are k = 3 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 3.
    - There are n = 4 fraction bits.
2. Format B
    - There are k = 4 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 7.
    - There are n = 3 fraction bits.

Below, you are given some bit patterns in format A, and your task is to convert them to the closest value in format B. If necessary, you should apply the round-to-even rounding rule. In addition, give the values of numbers given by the format A and format B bit patterns. Give these as whole numbers (e.g., 17) or as fractions (e.g., 17/64).

||Format A||||Format B||

If exponent not all 0's or all 1's. Use normalized form n: e - Bias

Format A Value is:
1. e (exponent field value)= 2^2 + 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5
2. Calculate E (actual exponent) normalized values:
    - k = 3
    - Bias = 2^(k-1) - 1 
    - 2^(3-1) = 2^2 = 4
    - 4 - 1 = 3
    - bias is 3.
    - E = e - bias = 5 - 3 = 2
3. Calculate 2^E:
    E = 2
    2^2 = 4
    2^E = 4
4. Calculate f:
    - 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 0/16
    - Find the prime factorization of each number. (Break each number down into a product of prime numbers).
        - 2 = 2^1
        - 4 = 2 x 2 = 2^2
        - 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^3
        - 16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^4
    - The only prime factor is 2

    - For each prime factor, identify the highest power (the most times it appears) in any of the factorizations.
    - The highest is 2^4 = 16 this is the common denominator
    - For 1/2: To change the denominator from 2 to 16, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 8:
        - 1/2 = 1 x 8 / 2 x 8 = 8 / 16
    - For 1/4: To change the denominator from 4 to 16, we multiply both by 4:
        - 1/4 = 1 x 4 / 4 x 4 = 4 / 16
    - For 1/8: To change the denominator from 8 to 16, we multiply both by 2:
        - 1/8 = 1 x 2 / 8 x 2 = 2 / 16        
    - Now that all fractions have the same denominator, we can add their numerators:
        - 8/16 + 4/16 + 2/16 + 0/16 = 14/16
        - Therefore: f = 14/16
        - Greatest common factor is 2 so
        - Simplified to 7/8
5. Calculate M for normalized Values:
    - M = 1 + f
    - fractional part f is 7/8
    - Convert 1 7/8 to improper fraction
    - Multiple 1 by denominator 8
    - 1 x 8 = 8
    - Add to the numerator 7 + 8 = 15
    - Place 15 over original denominator 8
    - M = 15/8
6. Calculate 2^E x M:
    - 2^E x M = 2^2 x 15/8
    - E = 2
    - M = 15/8
    - 2^2 = 4
    - 4 x 15/8 = 60/8
    - 2^E x M = 60/8
7. Calculate V
    - Can 60/8 be simplified? Yes
8. Simplify the fraction part, by finding the common divisor of 60
   - Use prime factorization (break each number down into a product of prime numbers).
    - divide 60 by a prime number until a whole number is found
        - 60 divided by prime 2 is 30
        - first product is 2
    - divide 30 by a prime number until a whole number is found
        - 30 divided by prime 2 is 15
        - second product is 2
    - divide 15 by a prime number until a whole number is found
        - 15 divided by prime 3 is 5
        - third product is 3
    - 5 is a prime number, so fourth  product is 5
    - 2 x 2 x 3 x 5 = 60
    - 2^2 x 3 x 5
9. Simplify the fraction part, by finding the common divisor of 8
   - Use prime factorization (break each number down into a product of prime numbers).
    - divide 8 by a prime number until a whole number is found
        - 8 divided by prime 2 is 4
        - first product is 2
    - divide 40 by a prime number until a whole number is found
        - 4 divided by prime 2 is 2
        - second product is 2
    - 2 is a prime number, so third  product is 2
    - 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
    - 2^2 x 2 = 8 
9. The greatest common factor is 2^2 = 4
    - 60 divided by 4 = 15
    - 8 divided by 4 = 2
    - so 60/8 simplified it 15/2 
10. The value is 15/2 or 7 1/2 or 7.5 decimal

Format B Value is:

1. Find binary representation of 15/2
    - One simple way to think about fractional binary representations is to represent a number as a fraction of the form x/2^k.
    - For improper fraction 15/2, we have decimal 15 which is in binary 1111
    - 1/2 is at the -1 binary position, so k is 1
    - We then put the binary point 1 positions from the right to get binary representation of 111.1
2. Normalize the binary number to find E (actual exponent)
    - Normalize number, express the binary number in the form of 1.xxxxxx * 2^exponent.
    - shift the binary point until it is immediately after the leading '1'.
    - The number of positions the binary point is shifted determines the exponent.
    - 111.1 = 1.111 x 2^2
    - 2 shifts were needed here
    - E is 2
3. Calculate e (exponent field value) normalized values:
    - k = 4
    - Bias = 2^(k-1) - 1 
    - 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8
    - 8 - 1 = 7
    - bias is 7
    - e = E + bias
    - e = 2 + 7 = 9
    - e into binary k=4 bits
    - 1001

    - The only prime factor is 2

    - For each prime factor, identify the highest power (the most times it appears) in any of the factorizations.
    - The highest is 2^3 = 8 this is the common denominator
    - For 1/2: To change the denominator from 2 to 8, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4:
        - 1/2 = 1 x 4 / 2 x 4 = 4 / 8
    - For 1/4: To change the denominator from 4 to 8, we multiply both by 4:
        - 1/4 = 1 x 2 / 4 x 2 = 2 / 8
        - Now that all fractions have the same denominator, we can add their numerators:
        - 4/8 + 2/8 + 1/8 = 17/8
        - Therefore: f = 7/8
        - This is simplified
5. Calculate M for normalized Values:
    - M = 1 + f
    - fractional part f is 7/8
    - Convert 1 7/8 to improper fraction
